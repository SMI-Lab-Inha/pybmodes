"""Tests for the degenerate FA/SS eigenpair resolver in elastodyn.params.

The resolver detects consecutive modes whose relative frequency gap is below
``_DEGENERATE_FREQ_RTOL`` (1e-4) and rotates them inside their shared 2D
eigenspace so the first comes out FA-pure and the second SS-pure. This
removes a class of classifier ambiguity on perfectly symmetric structures
where the eigensolver's basis choice within the degenerate subspace is
arbitrary.
