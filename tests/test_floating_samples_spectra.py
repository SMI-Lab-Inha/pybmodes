"""Regression: the bundled floating reference-turbine samples must
produce physically-valid, ``n_modes``-stable rigid-body spectra.

These tests read only repo-shipped sample data
(``src/pybmodes/_examples/sample_inputs/reference_turbines/``), so they
run in the default (self-contained) suite — same data-independence
rule as ``verify.py`` and ``test_reference_decks.py``.

Why this exists
---------------
Up to and including v1.1.0 the floating samples were emitted with
cantilever-proxy section properties (``axial_stff = 1e6·EI``,
~5e6× too stiff for a real tower, and a near-zero rotary-inertia
floor). For the clamped-base land / monopile samples that is harmless
(axial + torsion DOFs are locked at the base). For the FREE-base
floating samples (``hub_conn = 2``) it wrecked the conditioning of the
global matrices: on the OC3-Hywind-style asymmetric platform the soft
rigid-body modes collapsed into a single degenerate value whose
magnitude *drifted with the requested mode count* — the surge / sway /
heave / roll / pitch / yaw spectrum came out wrong while the
tower-bending pair stayed roughly right, so the build-time
"1st-FA > 0.3 Hz" check and the PlatformSupport round-trip test both
missed it. The fix emits physically-scaled section properties for the
floating path; these tests pin both invariants the old code violated:

1. The spectrum is ``n_modes``-invariant (a count-dependent eigenvalue
   is the signature of an ill-conditioned generalised eigenproblem).
2. The OC3 Hywind sample reproduces the BModes JJ reference spectrum
   (Jonkman 2010, NREL/TP-500-47535; BModes v1.03 JJ run) — the six
   rigid-body modes + first tower-bending pair — to engineering
   tolerance.
