"""Headless execution of the bundled walkthrough notebooks.

Two notebooks are exercised:

- ``notebooks/walkthrough.ipynb`` — contractually self-contained tour
  of the public API (synthetic uniform-blade and tower cases with
  closed-form references). The README's "start here" introduction.
  Runs in the **default** suite — every PR exercises it end-to-end.

- ``cases/iea15_umainesemi_walkthrough.ipynb`` — the IEA-15-240-RWT
  UMaineSemi end-to-end walkthrough. Depends on upstream OpenFAST
  decks gitignored under the Independence stance. Two assertions:

  * Default-suite: with the upstream data **absent**, the first code
    cell must raise a *friendly* ``FileNotFoundError`` whose message
    points at the upstream IEA-15-240-RWT repo. This is the
    documented contract; without a test we'd be trusting the design,
    not verifying it.
  * Integration-marked: with the upstream data **present**, every
    cell must execute without error. Skipped on a fresh clone so the
    default suite stays self-contained.

Requires the optional ``[notebook]`` extra (``nbclient`` /
``nbformat`` / ``ipykernel``); the test skips at collection time if
any are missing so a contributor running with only ``[dev]`` sees a
clean ``SKIPPED`` rather than an import-time error.
