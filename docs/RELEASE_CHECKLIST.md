# pyBmodes release checklist

Run every item before tagging a new pyBmodes version. The goal is
not "the build looks green" — it's "nothing about the release is
unverified". Each step is a quick local command plus an explicit
expected outcome.

## 0. Prerequisites

Activate the dev environment (Windows + conda example; adapt for
your shell):

```cmd
call C:\Users\<you>\miniconda3\Scripts\activate.bat pybmodes
set PYTHONPATH=D:\repos\pyBModes\src
```

Working tree should be clean before starting:

```bash
git status
# expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
```

## 1. Default test suite (self-contained, no external data)

```bash
pytest -q
```

Expected: every collected test passes. The default run skips
integration-marked tests cleanly (see VALIDATION.md "What needs
external data" for the list).

## 2. Integration test suite (needs local OpenFAST + BModes decks)

```bash
pytest -m integration -q
```

Expected: every collected test passes. If you don't have the
upstream decks cloned under `docs/`, this step exits with code 5
("no tests collected") — that's acceptable for a local pre-tag pass
**only** if you've separately verified the integration track on
another machine that does have the data. CI runs both steps; the
integration job's exit-5 path is allowed but every other failure
mode is a hard fail.

## 3. Linting + type checking

```bash
python -m ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/
python -m mypy src/pybmodes
```

Expected: both clean. `scripts/` is gated because user-facing
workflows (build_reference_decks, campbell, visualise_*) live there
and any regression in them is user-visible.

## 4. Sample-input verifier

```bash
python cases/sample_inputs/verify.py
```

Expected: every analytical-reference sample passes at < 1 % RMS
against its closed-form reference. Output ends with a summary line
like ``Result: 4/4 sample case(s) passed.``.

## 4.5. Validation-matrix audit

```bash
python scripts/audit_validation_claims.py
```

Expected: ``OK: every VALIDATION.md test-file reference exists and
contains at least one test method``. The script parses every
``tests/...`` link in `VALIDATION.md`, asserts the path exists, and
asserts the file (or directory glob) contains at least one
``def test_…`` method — catching the "claim ahead of test" drift
where the matrix advertises behaviour with no enforcing test. A
non-zero exit is a release blocker; either add the missing test or
remove the row from the matrix before tagging.

## 5. Reference-deck regeneration + validator

```bash
python scripts/build_reference_decks.py
```

Expected: every case in the manifest builds successfully; the post-
patch validation report ends in ``Overall: PASS`` or ``Overall:
WARN``. A FAIL verdict on any case is a release blocker. The
IEA-15 UMaine VolturnUS-S case is expected to end in WARN on
TwSSM2Sh — that's documented in `reference_decks/FLOATING_CASES.md`
and `reference_decks/iea15mw_umainesemi/validation_report.txt`'s
footer; treat any other WARN as new and investigate before
shipping.

## 6. Walkthrough notebook smoke-check

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/walkthrough.ipynb --output _smoke.ipynb
```

Expected: every cell executes without error. Inspect the rendered
notebook briefly to confirm the figures aren't empty / clipped.
Delete `notebooks/_smoke.ipynb` afterwards (it's a transient
artefact).

## 7. Case scripts (optional — produce PNGs under `outputs/`)

```bash
for case in cases/bir_2010_land_tower cases/bir_2010_monopile \
            cases/bir_2010_floating cases/nrel5mw_land \
            cases/iea3mw_land cases/nrel5mw_monopile; do
    python "$case/run.py"
done
```

Expected: each writes its PNGs without raising. These are local-data-
dependent for the BModes case-test decks; the cases under
`cases/nrel5mw_*/` need `docs/OpenFAST_files/r-test/` and the IEA-3.4
case needs `docs/OpenFAST_files/IEA-3.4-130-RWT/`. Missing-data exits
should be obvious from the per-case error message.

## 8. Version + CHANGELOG promotion

- `pyproject.toml`: bump `version = "X.Y.Z"` from previous tag's value.
- `src/pybmodes/__init__.py`: bump the dev fallback string `__version__ = "X.Y.Z-dev"`.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: promote the `## [Unreleased]` block to `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`; reset `[Unreleased]` to `(nothing yet)`.

Commit with a stand-alone message like
``chore: bump version to X.Y.Z, promote CHANGELOG``. Verify the
commit's stat shows only those three files changed.

## 9. Tag + push

```bash
git push origin master
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "pyBmodes X.Y.Z — <one-line release headline>"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The `v` prefix is the standard convention PyPI, GitHub Releases,
and conda-forge all expect. Push the master branch *before* the tag
so the tag refers to a commit that's on the remote.

## 10. GitHub Release

On https://github.com/SMI-Lab-Inha/pyBModes/releases/new :

1. Choose tag: `vX.Y.Z`.
2. Release title: `pyBmodes X.Y.Z`.
3. Paste the relevant `## [X.Y.Z]` section from CHANGELOG.md as the
   release notes body. Add a brief Highlights section above the
   detailed changelog if the changeset is large enough to warrant
   one (the X.Y.0 minor-bumps usually do; patch-only bumps usually
   don't).
4. Set as the latest release: ✓ (unless this is a back-port).
5. Publish.

The GitHub Actions CI badge in README will repaint to green on the
new tag's commit automatically.

## 11. Post-release sanity

```bash
git fetch --tags
git tag -l "v*" | tail -5
```

Expected: the new tag is in the list and matches what's on origin.

```bash
pip install -e . --quiet
python -c "import pybmodes; print(pybmodes.__version__)"
```

Expected: the version reported matches the tag exactly (no `-dev`
suffix — the install picks up the value from `pyproject.toml`).

---

If any step fails, **do not push the tag**. Fix the underlying
issue and re-run from the point of failure. The checklist exists
because the cost of a botched public tag (deleting it, retagging,
re-publishing) is much higher than the cost of running through ten
local verifications first.
