    1. **Direction**: only candidates classified as the requested
       axis (FA or SS) are considered.
    2. **Torsion contamination**: candidates whose modal kinetic-
       energy torsion fraction crosses
       :data:`_TORSION_REJECT_THRESHOLD` (10 %) are dropped from the
       selection — they're hybrid modes ElastoDyn's polynomial
       ansatz can't faithfully represent. Their mode numbers are
       returned in :attr:`_TowerFamilySelectionResult.rejected_modes`
       so the user can see what was dropped.

    Among the candidates that survive both gates, the lowest-frequency
    candidate becomes the first family member; the next higher-frequency
    candidate whose clamped-base polynomial fit is still good
    (``rms_residual <= 0.09``) becomes the second. If no such
    higher-frequency candidate has a good fit, we fall back to the
    best-fit candidate among the surviving ones.

    Robustness: if fewer than two candidates survive the torsion gate
    we fall back to the full (un-filtered) family and emit an empty
    ``rejected_modes`` — better to return SOMETHING than to crash on a
    pathological deck where every higher mode is torsion-contaminated.
