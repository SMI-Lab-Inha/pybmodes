"""Patch ElastoDyn .dat files with computed polynomial coefficients.

Each coefficient occupies a separate line of the form:
    <value>   <ParamName(k)>   - comment text
The writer finds each line by matching the parameter name token, then replaces
the leading value in-place, preserving indentation and all trailing text.
