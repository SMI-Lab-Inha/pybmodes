"""Parser, writer, and pyBmodes adapter for OpenFAST ElastoDyn ``.dat``
files.

ElastoDyn ``.dat`` files come in three flavours, all of which share a
common line-ordered convention: each significant line carries a value
(or short list) followed by a label keyword and an optional ``-
comment`` tail. The parsers below are **label-based** rather than
position-based, which keeps them robust across the FAST v8 → OpenFAST
v3+ format drift (renamed/added/removed scalars between versions;
``BldFile(1)`` vs ``BldFile1``).

Three entry points cover the three file flavours:

* :func:`read_elastodyn_main`  — the top-level ElastoDyn input file.
* :func:`read_elastodyn_tower` — the tower-properties file referenced
  via ``TwrFile``.
* :func:`read_elastodyn_blade` — the blade-properties file referenced
  via ``BldFile(1..3)``.

Each returns a dataclass holding the parsed values plus enough raw-
line metadata to re-emit a semantically identical file via the
matching ``write_*`` function.

Two adapter helpers turn a parsed ElastoDyn bundle into pyBmodes
``BMIFile`` + ``SectionProperties`` records ready for the FEM core:

* :func:`to_pybmodes_tower(main, tower, blade=None)`
* :func:`to_pybmodes_blade(main, blade)`

The implementation lives in the private sub-package
``pybmodes.io._elastodyn``:

* ``types``   — dataclasses
* ``lex``     — line/token scanning helpers
* ``parser``  — line-driven flavour parsers
* ``writer``  — canonical re-emitters
* ``adapter`` — pyBmodes BMI/SectionProperties synthesisers

This module re-exports the public names from those sub-modules so
existing ``from pybmodes.io.elastodyn_reader import …`` imports keep
working unchanged. Field-set discrepancies vs. the user-specified
spec are documented under each dataclass.

Round-trip contract
-------------------

``write_*`` functions emit a canonically formatted file that **parses
back to an equal dataclass** but is not byte-identical to the
original. Whitespace, label column position, and comment text are
normalised. The test suite compares the parse-emit-reparse fixed
point (see ``tests/test_elastodyn_reader.py``).
