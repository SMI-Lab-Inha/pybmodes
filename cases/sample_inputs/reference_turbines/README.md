# pyBmodes reference-wind-turbine BMI library

Six pyBmodes-authored BMI samples for the open-literature **reference
wind turbines** (RWTs) cited routinely in the wind-energy literature,
spanning **2009 – 2024** in publication date and **3.4 – 22 MW** in
rated power. Every numerical value is sourced from the named
publication or its public companion deck; the file format,
commentary, and citations are pyBmodes-authored and the files are
MIT-licensed alongside the rest of the project.

Each turbine ships **two BMI samples** — one for the tower, one for
the blade — so the sample library exercises both halves of the
pyBmodes modelling pipeline (cantilever tower + rotating cantilever
blade with centrifugal stiffening).

These complement the four analytical-reference BMIs in the parent
[`cases/sample_inputs/`](../) directory — those validate pyBmodes'
FEM core against textbook formulas, while these demonstrate the
modelling pipeline against the wind-turbine designs cited routinely
in the literature.

Frequencies above are pyBmodes' result on the deck-as-distributed at
the time `build.py` was last run; the deck's RotSpeed is used for the
blade FEM so the flap-mode values include the centrifugal-stiffening
contribution.

## Modelling assumption

**Tower BMI**: `hub_conn = 1` (cantilevered base) clamped at TowerBsHt
with the RNA lumped at the tower top. RNA mass is computed as
`Hub + Nacelle + 3·BladeMass` (the blade mass is the
trapezoidal-rule integral of the blade `BMassDen` column over the
blade length). For monopile sub-cases this treats the substructure
below TowerBsHt as a rigid extension — the same simplification BModes
uses for ElastoDyn-compatible mode-shape generation. The 1st-FA
frequency that comes out is therefore **higher** than the actual
flexible-pile + tower combined-cantilever system frequency, by
5 – 80 % depending on pile length and foundation stiffness. For the
combined-cantilever physics use:

```python
from pybmodes.models import Tower
tower = Tower.from_elastodyn_with_subdyn(
    "path/to/<turbine>_ElastoDyn.dat",
    "path/to/<turbine>_SubDyn.dat",
)
```

That path is validated against BModes JJ on the OC3 monopile
(`tests/test_certtest.py::test_certtest_cs_monopile`) and is the right
choice for any quantitative monopile modal analysis.

**Blade BMI**: `hub_conn = 1` (cantilevered root) spun at the deck's
`RotSpeed`. No tip mass — these RWTs don't ship with tip-brakes. The
blade section-properties file preserves the deck's structural twist
(`StrcTwst` column), uses the standard pyBmodes adapter conventions
for torsion stiffness (`100 · EI`), axial stiffness (`10⁶ · EI`), and
rotary inertia floor (`10⁻⁶ · char² · m`). Centrifugal stiffening
lifts the lowest flap mode by a few percent at rated rotor speed;
users wanting a Campbell sweep across rotor speeds can drive the same
BMI with
[`pybmodes.campbell.campbell_sweep`](../../../src/pybmodes/campbell.py).

## A note on RWT-revision drift

Reference-wind-turbine structural definitions are **iteratively
revised** across releases. The same RWT designation (e.g.
`IEA-15-240-RWT`) at git-tag `v1.0.0` may have a few-percent
different section-property distribution than at `v2.0.0`, and the
companion publication's printed mode-shape frequencies were valid
*for the deck version at publication time* — not necessarily for
whatever revision is current in the upstream repository today.

The **pyBmodes frequencies** in the table above are derived from the
**deck-as-distributed** at the time `build.py` was last run. The
**published reference frequencies** quoted in each per-turbine README
are the values the original publication printed at its publication
date. A drift between them typically reflects deck-revision evolution
since publication, **not a pyBmodes error**. Treat the published
values as historical anchors, not regression targets.

## Floating cases

The OC3 Hywind floating spar and the IEA-15 / IEA-22 floating
sub-cases (UMaine semi, etc.) are **not** generated by `build.py`
yet — those need a full `PlatformSupport` block with hydrostatic
restoring, hydrodynamic added mass, mooring stiffness, and platform-
inertia 6 × 6 matrices that ElastoDyn carries via separate HydroDyn
+ MoorDyn files (which the build script doesn't yet parse).

For the **OC3 Hywind spar specifically**, pyBmodes ships a validated
solve via the BModes-format OC3Hywind.bmi (gitignored under
`docs/BModes/docs/examples/`; clone the BModes repository locally to
get it). That solve matches BModes JJ to 0.0003 % across the first
nine modes per `test_certtest_oc3hywind`. Re-authoring an equivalent
sample BMI with citations to Jonkman (2010) is on the roadmap.

## Reproducibility

All BMI files in this directory are generated by the
[`build.py`](build.py) script. Re-running the script reads each
turbine's source ElastoDyn `.dat` decks and re-emits the four files
per turbine (tower BMI + tower section-properties + blade BMI + blade
section-properties) plus the per-turbine README. Sources for three of
the six turbines (NREL 5MW land, NREL 5MW OC3 monopile, IEA-3.4) are
in the bundled [`reference_decks/`](../../../reference_decks/);
sources for the other three (IEA-10, IEA-15, IEA-22 monopiles) live
under `docs/OpenFAST_files/<turbine>/` which is gitignored under the
project's "Independence stance" — `build.py` reads them when present
and skips otherwise.
